# World Quiz

## What it is:
* A quiz on random "world" facts with 20 seconds given to answer 5 questions - think fast! For each wrong answer, 5 seconds are subtracted from the timer. Good luck!

## How it's made
* Uses HTML, CSS & JavaScript
* I used Bootstap forms and buttons along with CSS styling for the layout
* Created 5 questions with 4 possible answers each (Buttons A/B/C/D), one questions displayed at a time
* Function that removes 5 seconds from the clock for wrong answers. Once the timer reaches 0 seconds, the game is over and the user is prompted to enter their Name & Score, displayed at the top right corner
